# MinneMUDAC 2019

The MinneMUDAC for 2019 focused on forecasting the price of soybean futures. I competed on a team
with 4 other people. Our team ended up placing in the top 3 out of 60 teams. \

In this repository, you will find the work that I did. All the code here was written by me. My primary responsibilities
were cleaning the data, estimating the effect that weather had on soybean yields, and creating ARIMA
and exponential smoothing models to be averaged into our final model. Most of the relevant scripts
can be found in ```src```. \
